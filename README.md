# CODENAME: Pitchfork

There's a lot of discussion, usually quite spirited, around the Cardano network parameters and what they mean for monetary
policy, decentralization, and the health of the network. Wouldn't it be awesome if someone built an open source tool to
try and objectively and without bias show what various network settings may mean for both stake pool operators as well
as delegates?

Well, never fear! A group of volunteers is here to try and do just that. This is a baby project just in its infancy,
but we'll try to make a tool that is: Open Source, publicly available, deployable by any project or person that is so
interested, and accurately reflects the effects of the Cardano RSS as it is deployed on the network.
